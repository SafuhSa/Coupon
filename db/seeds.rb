# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#  track2 = Track.new(title: 'Talk To me', artist_id: artist1.id)
#  file = EzDownload.open('https://s3.amazonaws.com/sonorise-dev/02+Talk+to+Me.mp3')
#  track2.audio.attach(io: file, filename: '02_Talk_to_Me.mp3')
#  track2.save!
